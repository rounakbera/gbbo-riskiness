One of them is eliminated every week until the finale, where three chefs compete to be crowned the champion.","Every episode of the Great British Bake Off has three challenges: the Signature, Technical, and Showstopper. However, bakers only really get to choose their ingredients in the Signature and Showstopper, so those are what we chose to focus on. The Signature bake is intended for contestants to display their personality and creativity, while on the other hand, the Showstopper bake is designed to wow the judges, both visually and flavor-wise.","We watched three seasons of the show and took meticulous notes on the ingredients and flavor combinations each baker used. We also noted the Judgesâ€™ evaluation of the riskiness of choices and their overall reaction to their bakes."]} images={[IntroGif,Challenges,DataCollection]}/>
