He used mostly classic ingredients including dates and honey to sweeten and cinnamon and ginger to flavor 
He did well in the bake, Paul and Mary were both impressed. However, it was not the most original, as another baker Paul also attempted a similar carrot cake for the challenge.
So this was a Good Bake but Not Risky
