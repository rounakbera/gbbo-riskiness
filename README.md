# Managing Risk in Your Competitive Baking Flavor Portfolio
**Created by Stacy Tao, Ria Garg, Tian Low, and Rounak Bera**

This repository contains the code for our data visualization of *The Great British Bake Off*, which is hosted [here](https://rounakbera.github.io/gbbo-riskiness/).

We primarily used [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) and [React-Scrollama](https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama), as well as some other libraries such as [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [rc-slider](https://github.com/schrodinger/rc-slider).
